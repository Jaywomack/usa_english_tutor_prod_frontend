Hello, I’m teacher Whitney, and today we are going to talk about tips for improving your English. These tips are very useful when learning a foreign or second language. They help you learn faster and retain the information.

I like to think of these four different categories as the core of English learning. These categories include listening, speaking, reading, and writing. Also I have some additional words of encouragement. Without further ado here are my best tips for improving your English;

### 1. Listening

Listen to English on multiple platforms during the day while you are doing tasks. Train your brain every day. When you’re just starting you want to listen to clear and slow English.

Don’t translate English from your own language, try to think in English to improve your fluency. This will also help you develop speaking confidence.

Whatever your reason for learning English let’s prepare! Record your voice, check your pronunciation, and intonation. Adjust if you need, this will help you so much by identifying your problem areas.
Be honest with yourself.

> “I only wish I could find an institute that teaches people how to listen. Business people need to listen at least as much as they need to talk. Too many people fail to realize that real communication goes in both directions.”

— _Lee Iacocca_, former president and CEO, Chrysler Corporation

### 2. Speaking

The most natural way to learn grammar is through speaking. You need to surround yourself in English. You can post vocabulary words on items around your home and office and speak the word when you encounter it!

Speak with non-native speakers as well as native speakers, opportunities to practice are everywhere!

Try using your new vocabulary in a sentence for EXAMPLE; Strongest. My dad is the strongest man I have met. To be the strongest you have to work out every day at the gym. We drank the strongest wines at dinner.

Another great speaking strategy is actually learned through song. You can learn the song by looking the words up online and trying to sing along with the song.

### 3. Reading

This method can be very helpful to reinforce vocabulary and also encourage you to learn some new vocabulary that you might not have encountered so far in your other lessons.

The great thing about reading is you can purchase content that is at your current reading level and your ability. Your reading comprehension can grow as large as you want depending on how much time you put into reading.

Also English words can be found everywhere in English speaking countries, for those of you who are not in an English speaking environment you have the internet to search for English words. I would suggest searching for something that you find interesting and reading about it in English.

### 4. Writing

Just like when we practice our speaking using new vocabulary words in sentences and writing them down can help with error correction and word fluency. This is great for helping you remember these new words too!

You might not live near English speakers so something you can do is go to online English chat rooms/ forums/ my video comments threads, anywhere that is speaking English and write your English with others who are also English learning.

### 5. Extra tips that are sooo...important

Make yourself a study plan, how many hours per day, days per week are you going to study English? The more you learn the sooner you can speak English like a native speaker.

Find ways to challenge yourself. Dont stress, take your time to really learn. Don’t give up if it gets hard, you can't learn English well in one week so dont be hard on yourself. Also don't be afraid to make mistakes, find joy in your learning, we learn more when we are having fun.

Review past lessons often so the material sticks with you better.
These are my best tips for improving your English I hope this helps you!
